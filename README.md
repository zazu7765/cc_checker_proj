# Credit Card Checker Project #  

## Background ##  

This project is something I encountered on [CodeCademy](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/credit-card-checker-challenge-project-javascript/462375)
and the objective of it is to basically create your own credit card checker using the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description) (used by actual companies)  
Technically you could run your own verification software using this which is super cool, and is a good real life application of mathematics.  

## Project Context ##  

The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!  

## Things you can do with this ##  

- Run your own credit card! (this doesn't log anything, check the code if you want )  
- Use a random credit card generator to mess around!  
- Add a function that converts invalid cards to valid ones!  
- Remake the functions in your own style, these use CodeCademy's basic function syntax and no arrow syntax
